## Why Use Web Scraping for eBay?

A web scraper allows you to select the exact data you want from eBay and download it as an **Excel** or **JSON file** for further analysis. This automation saves time and effort compared to manually gathering data.

For this tutorial, we'll use **ParseHub**, a free and powerful tool that works with any website. You can [download ParseHub for free here](https://www.parsehub.com/quickstart?ref=parsehub.com) before starting.

## Getting Started: Scraping eBay Data

We will scrape eBay search results for the term "Smartphone" and extract product details, pricing, and more.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project
1. **Install ParseHub** and open it.
2. Click on ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù and enter the URL of the eBay search results page you want to scrape. For example:

   The page will render inside the app.

## Scraping More Details

Currently, ParseHub is scraping data only from the search results page. To extract more detailed information, such as seller ratings or product descriptions, we need to scrape individual product pages.

### Step 1: Set Up Click Commands
1. Click the **PLUS(+)** sign next to your ‚Äúproduct‚Äù selection and choose the **Click** command.
2. A pop-up will ask if this is a ‚Äúnext page‚Äù link. Select **No** and name this template ‚Äúproduct_page.‚Äù ParseHub will now navigate to the product page of the first listing.

### Step 2: Extract Seller Details

2. Use the **PLUS(+)** sign and **Select** command to extract additional seller details, such as:
   - Seller rating.
   - Number of reviews.

   Your project should now look like this:
