## Step-by-Step Guide to Scraping Etsy API Data

### **1. Obtain an Etsy API Key**

The first step is to apply for an API key, which may take a few days. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Etsy account.
2. Navigate to the [Etsy Developer Apps page](https://www.etsy.com/developers/your-apps) and create a new application.
3. **Important:** Avoid using the word ‚ÄúEtsy‚Äù in your app name to prevent rejection.
4. Provide a valid website URL (e.g., your Etsy shop URL if you‚Äôre a seller).

Once your application is approved, you‚Äôll find your API key under the **keystring** field in your Etsy developer account:
