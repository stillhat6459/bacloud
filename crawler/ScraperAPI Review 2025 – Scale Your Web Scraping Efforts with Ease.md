const ScraperAPI = require('scraperapi-sdk');
const apiKey = 'SCRAPE9837861'; // Replace with your ScraperAPI key
const scraper = new ScraperAPI(apiKey);

async function scrapeWebsiteContent(url) {
  try {
    let response = await scraper.get(url);
    console.log('Response data:', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error scraping website:', error);
  }
}

let url = 'https://google.com'; // Replace with the URL you want to scrape
scrapeWebsiteContent(url);
```

#### **Steps to Run the Code:**
